        <p>My Name is Tysheba L. Morgan.  I was born on December 13th, 1974 in Cleveland, Ohio. My parents are Tyrone Morgan and Frances Elizabeth Gregley.  I am the third child of six - four girls and two boys. </p>
        <p>I graduated from Howard Univerty with a Masters in Finance.  I've always loved to work with numbers. I was good in math as a child so I studied accounting and finance in school.  I have the following certifications</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Certified Public Accountant (CPA)</li>
            <li>Certified Internal Auditor (CIA)</li>
            <li>Certified Management Accountant (CMA)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now I realized I have a love for programming and fashion. I know this sounds totally crazy.  I really started to appreciate technology and what programming can do while working in the finance and accounting profession. 
            In all the corporate jobs I have had, my proudest accomplishments are using technology to make processes simpler and more efficient.  
            Whether it was an Excel Spreadsheet, Access Database, or working with our in-house geeks to create a program. I loved doing it.  However, what was most frustrating
            was sometimes the results were not ideal when someone else was doing the developing.  The developers didn't always get it and oftenweren't interested in making
            things user friendly.  in many cases, the resulting program didn't do everything we needed so we created work arounds and wasted more time doing so.  
            I believe I can be a great programmer and build programs that will save people a lot of time and frustration.</p>
        <p>One the fashion side - I am the co-owner of a boutique called Charm City Boutique located in the University area of Charlotte, North Carolina. My boyfriend and I love to buy clothes from all over the world,
            put outfits together, and sell them.  We also love being entrepenuers.  Our goal is to retire young and rich.
